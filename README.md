# Remote-File-Management-System
Project Idea: Remote File Management System using Command Pattern
Objective:
Develop a Remote File Management System that allows users to perform various file operations (like create, delete, move, copy) on a remote server, using the Command design pattern. The aim is to enable the execution of different file operations in a way that the operations can be encapsulated as objects, allowing for flexible and extensible command execution, undo operations, and logging.

## Tasks
### Understanding the Command Pattern
Begin with a study of the Command design pattern, emphasizing its role in encapsulating a request as an object.
Discuss how it allows parameterization of objects with operations and can support undoable operations.

### Designing Command Interface
Define a common command interface with an execute() method and, optionally, an undo() method.
Examples of commands could be CreateFileCommand, DeleteFileCommand, MoveFileCommand, etc.

### Implementing Concrete Commands
Create concrete classes for each file operation, implementing the command interface.
Each class should encapsulate all necessary details to perform the operation, such as file names, source and destination paths.

### Developing the Invoker Class
Create an invoker class that is responsible for taking and executing commands.
The invoker can maintain a history of commands executed, to facilitate undo operations.

### Creating the Receiver Class
Implement a receiver class that knows how to perform the actual file operations.
The command objects will delegate the execution to the methods defined in the receiver.

### Building a Client Interface
Develop a client interface (like a GUI or command-line interface) where users can input their file operation commands.
The client should create command objects based on user input and pass them to the invoker for execution.

### Adding Undo Functionality
Implement an undo mechanism in the invoker class that can reverse the effects of the last executed command.
This might involve storing a history of executed commands and their state.

### Logging and Monitoring
Incorporate logging to keep track of executed commands and their outcomes.
Optionally, add features to monitor ongoing operations and manage queued commands.

### Testing and Debugging
Test each command for various scenarios, including normal operation, failure cases, and undo operations.
Debug and refine the system to handle edge cases and errors gracefully.

### Documentation and Reporting
Prepare comprehensive documentation of the system architecture, design decisions, and user instructions.
Write a report or presentation detailing the development process, challenges faced, and how they were addressed.
